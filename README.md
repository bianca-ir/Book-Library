# Book-Library

Project based on CRUD operations, with a graphical interface created using Qt framework. Users can add, update and delete books. The repository is already initialized with five books. 

I learned: 

* applying OOP concepts in C++
* working with Qt framework 
* building a project based on MVC architecture
